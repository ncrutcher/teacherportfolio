<h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;font-family:cambria">All About Me</h1>
<p style="color:white;text-align:center;font-family:calibri">My name is Natashia Crutcher. I grew up in Frisco, 	TX before 

anyone knew where Frisco was. I graduated from The Colony High School in 2005. I started 

Collin College in the fall of 2012. I graduated from Collin College in May of 2016 with an 

Associate's of the Arts in general studies, as well as an Associate's of the Arts in 

Teaching. I started school at TWU in Denton in the fall of 2016. I graduated with my 

Bachelor's in Mathematics and Education in May of 2019. I am now working on my Master's 

degree. I have two beautiful children that are my reason for everything I have 

accomplished. My son, Draven, is 13 years old, and my daughter, Ellie, is 8 years old. My 

boyfriend, William, has three kids as well. His oldest son, Dillon, is 16 years old, his 

daughter, Hailey, is 15 years old, and his youngest son, Jordan, is 8 years old. We also 

have a pit bull named Desmond. We have a very full house to say the least, so we refer to ourselves as: the Peters Bunch.</p>
